A pretty barebones RomFS comparission tool. Mainly made to speed up the process of viewing new file additions in new patches. I will try to change it to compare the checksum of each file to check if any files that retained the same file name changed at all. 

This is the ArrayList implementation and I will rewrite it using a bloom filter at some point to allow for MUCH more efficiency.
